## Motivation
Brainly is greedy for money, and if there is to be communism in the world, they should not have so much money. So I created this two-line code so that they wouldn't earn so much anymore, and you comrades would no longer have to pay for this private enterprise, and you would have more money to pay taxes for our government. Слава СССР!
